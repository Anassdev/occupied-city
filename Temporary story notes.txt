Start with modern day population/area of [city] and then add
    - exodus in proportion w/ Pal
    - wall construction with area in proportion?
    - settler numbers in proportion



Universe B: day 1
[London] comes under the auspices of a new, external governing force not fully understood by its residents.
You are issued a new passport. It doesn't look like your old one.

> fast forward

year 1 [1947]

    A new power has begun claiming huge amounts of land in [London] and displacing residents. Some of your neighbouring boroughs made noises like they were going to help you out, but it doesn't seem to have worked so well. [London] doesn't have an army and the newcomers have been well supplied by their friends internationally.
    
year 2 [1948]
    750,000 Palestinians forced to leave their homes ~ http://www.unrwa.org/palestine-refugees
    
    
year 21 [ 1967 ]
    Amid heightened tensions, the new force makes a series of preemptive strikes against friends of [London]
    A battle breaks out. [London]'s casualties are far greater than those of its opponents. Following the war,
    its borders are entirely controlled by the occupier.
    
    325,000 forced to flee ~ http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/11587

year 26 [ 1972 ]
    For years after the war ~21,000 forced to leave every year - http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/11587

year 55 [ 2001 ]
    Education for former [Londoners] who have been forced out the city looks starkly different from that offered to the occupiers' children. Human rights agencies note that although a quarter of the children educated in the occupier's area are [London citizens], they are typically segragated and educated separately in schools with worse conditions.

year 56 [ 2002 ]
    The occupier has started building a wall encompassing most of the remaining areas of [London]. Most of it is electrified, some is made of concrete but is 8 meters tall. Some outside are calling it a security fence. Most [Londoners] are referring to it as the racist apartheid wall. The planned area will take more land from inside [London]'s current borders, and will encompass illegal settlements under the guise of security.
    
    [ "The fence/wall, in its present configuration, violates Israelâ€™s obligations under international humanitarian law"

year 65 [ 2011 ]
    [ London ] makes a bid to be recognised as a real city by a body that might give it some international recognition
    In retaliation the occupier freezes tax revenues to the local government while still collecting tax from citizens, sending
    the city into financial chaos and threatening all public services. Nobody knows when revenues will resume.
    [ Israel froze Palestinian tax revenues in 2011 after Palestine was admitted as a member of UN cultural agency UNESCO. It was widely acknowledged as a humanitarian risk - http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=439273 ]
    
year 66 [ 2012 ]
    The occupier freezes tax again in response to London's successful bid for a minimal level of recognition outside its walls.
    [ "After the Palestinians won the upgraded U.N. rank of observer state in November 2012, Israel froze the tax monies and also announced plans for 3,000 homes in a highly sensitive area of the West Bank, as well as in annexed east Jerusalem, triggering a furious response from the international community." http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/01/05/U-S-opposes-Israel-s-freeze-on-Palestinian-tax-revenue.html ]
    
year 68 [ 2014 ]
    The occupiers have decided to withold tax revenues from [London] again - this time as a result of a bid to attain the legal standing to challenge the occupation's injustices internationally.
    [ Palestinian tax was frozen (again) in January 2015 after the Palestinian government decided to join the International Criminal Court - http://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-withholds-palestinian-tax-revenues-1420312156 ]

year 69 [ 2015 ]

    Over {{500}} [London] residents are now held by the occupying power with no charge under administrative detention. Each such detention can be renewed at the last second based on only secret 'evidence', amounting to indefinite incarceration without trial. The people of [London] are accused of crimes which they are tried for in a language they cannot speak. These actions are condemned by some internationally - but the occupier maintains overwhelmingly greater support.
    

Over {{5 million}} modern day refugees are living in surrounding areas. They have their own dedicated United Nations agency.
